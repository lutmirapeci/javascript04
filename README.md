# Exercise 01

```
Write a JavaScript function that takes an array and a chunk size as input and returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array has a length equal to the chunk size.
Example:
chunkArray([1,2,3,4,5], 2) should return [[1,2], [3,4], [5]]
```

# Exercise 02

```
Implement a queue using an array.
Create function enqueue(item) to add an item to the queue (use push()) and also create function dequeue() to remove the first item from the queue (use shift()).
Test the queue by adding and removing items.
```

# Exercise 03

```
Create a JavaScript program that iterates in an array of different numbers and checks if the number is prime or not. Print on the console an array with the result of these checks. Create a function that iterates through the array of numbers and another function that checks if the number is prime or not.
Remember, a prime number is a number greater than 1 that can only be divided (without a remainder) by 1 and itself.
Example: const numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
Result: [true, true, false, true, false, true, false, false, false];
```
